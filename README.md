# Second Brain

## Overview
Second Brain is a project inspired by Tiago Forte's concept of "Building a Second Brain". The goal of this project is to create a Telegram bot that acts as a personal knowledge management system, allowing users to store, organize, and process information shared with the bot. The bot will then automatically generate Notion pages with summarized content, links to the original sources, and suggestions for related topics.

## Features
- **Telegram Bot**: Interact with the Second Brain bot directly through Telegram.
- **Content Storage**: Save text, links, files, and other content shared with the bot.
- **Notion Integration**: Automatically generate Notion pages from saved content.

- **Suggestions**: Receive suggestions for related topics based on saved content.
